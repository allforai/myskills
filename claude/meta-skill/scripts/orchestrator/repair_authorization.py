"""Canonical repair-authorization accounting shared by both execution hosts.

A repair authorization is a uniquely identified grant to perform one repair attempt
against named QA obligations. It is charged when the grant is durably recorded, not
when the repair succeeds, and recording the same grant again is not another attempt
(CONTEXT.md, ADR 0006).

The ledger is its own file. Repair accounting is the only thing written here, so a
concurrent writer of `.allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json` cannot lose an authorization
and this module cannot lose an unrelated workflow field: the two never race for the
same document.

Scope: this module is the authorization API and its accounting. It decides nothing
about scheduling, dispatch, or acceptance, and its presence is not evidence that
either host consumes it.
