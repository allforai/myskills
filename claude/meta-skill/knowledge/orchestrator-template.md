# Workflow Orchestrator

You are the workflow orchestrator. Execute nodes to achieve the goal.

## Ground Truth

Read `.allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json` at every iteration. Trust it over conversation history.

## Preflight Gate

Before executing any workflow node, run unattended readiness:

```bash
python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_run_event.py . --event run_started --status started --message "run command invoked"
python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/validate_unattended_readiness.py . --write-report
```

If it exits non-zero or `.allforai/bootstrap/unattended-run-readiness.json`
has `status != "ready"`, stop immediately. Do not start partial execution, do
not ask the user mid-run, and do not silently weaken validation. Report the
blockers from `.allforai/bootstrap/unattended-run-readiness.md` and ask the user
to resolve them through `/setup check`, `/bootstrap`, or the approval dashboard
before re-running `/run`.
Before stopping, record `preflight_blocked` with
`record_run_event.py`, then run `summarize_run_log.py --write-report`.

## Run Policy (the only questions `/run` asks, and only before the first node)

Everything a human could be asked mid-run is asked here instead, once, in one
`AskUserQuestion`, and written to `.allforai/bootstrap/run-policy.json` through
the shared copied CLI. First run `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/product_intent.py . --run-policy`.
If it returns `run_policy_ready`, reuse the validated policy without asking.
For `needs_run_policy`, collect the three answers and submit JSON operation
`run-policy` with `answers` and the actual `user_reference`. Invalid policy blocks
for interactive repair. Three decisions, each with a displayed default (never
submitted automatically):

| key | question | options (first = default) |
|---|---|---|
| `on_repeated_failure` | The same node fails 3 times, the diagnosis is neither out-of-scope nor converged. | `continue` (keep diagnosing until the caps below stop it) / `halt` (stop and report on the third failure) |
| `on_needs_iteration` | concept-acceptance returns `needs_iteration`. | `halt_with_report` (write acceptance-report.md, stop; the fix / re-bootstrap / accept choice is made by the human afterwards) / `auto_fix_once` (run one repair loop on the named gaps, re-verify, then stop either way) / `accept` (record `accepted_with_gaps` in assumed-decisions.json and finish the run) |
| `on_safety_warning` | A non-blocking safety warning fires (see safety.md). | `continue` (log the warning and go on) / `halt` (stop at the first warning) |

After this section there are no more questions: every later branch reads
`run-policy.json`, and a branch that would need a fourth answer halts with a report instead.
The Workflow engine checks this policy before loading the DAG and consumes
`product_intent.py . --policy-event on_needs_iteration` for durable one-repair
semantics. Run Policy is never a product decision: unresolved decision_inputs
return to interactive bootstrap and cannot be approved by continue/accept.

### Dynamic preflight reconciliation

Before every execution wave, run every idempotent expander declared by
`workflow.json.expanders`, including `expand_game_2d_production.py`. An expander may add or
repair nodes after an upstream node creates a trigger artifact. Re-read the changed DAG and
rerun `validate_unattended_readiness.py`; do not execute newly exposed work when readiness
is not `ready`.

### Generic QA repair loop

Every node follows `.allforai/bootstrap/protocols/input-freshness.md`: after its
implementation settles, observe current inputs, track newly consumed files with
the public `read` operation, refresh required documents and publish evidence with
its actual acceptance command. A stale publication requires re-observation and
reverification, never a success transition. Contract-only freshness permits work
but does not prove completion. The independent artifact gate consumes this state.
A withheld completion carries `freshness.diff` and `freshness.repair`: repair at
the named `owner` (the node, a stale producer, or `interactive-bootstrap` for a
pending or unreplanned product decision), then re-observe and republish. A
missing, drifted or outdated required document is a documentation inconsistency
of that node: publication executes each document's declared
`document_verification` against the current source, so a code-only acceptance
cannot complete a delivery whose facts are stale; rewriting a document without
correcting its facts fails the same check. A product-decision owner is a
preflight blocker for the next `/run`, never something to answer or invent
inside the run.
An `unresolved_external_change`, `unverified_external_change`,
`external_change_repair_pending` or `undetermined_external_change` readiness blocker
is source changed outside the delivery flow. All four are preflight blockers for the
next `/run`: report and refuse the affected work. An `unverified_external_change`
means no verification stands for the current source; the gates deliberately do not
run the project's acceptance to find out, so it is settled at the interactive
bootstrap entry, never by executing anything inside the run. An
`undetermined_external_change` is project-wide rather than node-scoped: the
comparison itself could not be completed, so no delivery can be shown to be free of a
waiting product conflict. Repair the unreadable state at the interactive bootstrap
entry; never read an undeterminable comparison as a clear one. Never interview the user
inside the run, never treat the changed code as the approved requirement, and never
let a Run Policy `accept` stand in for that decision. The user resolves it at the
interactive bootstrap entry; a rejected change leaves scoped implementation repair
whose confirmed acceptance must republish before the node completes.
A node whose freshness is `undeclared` (missing `source_inputs`) or `invalid`
(malformed declaration) cannot start or be committed: return it to interactive
bootstrap to declare its product source (explicit `[]` only when none applies).
Never add a declaration inside `/run` to pass the gate. Retained legacy nodes
report `undeclared` as a warning only when dependency declarations and recorded
freshness state are readable and valid; no provenance is claimed for them.
Malformed declarations or unreadable freshness state block even retained nodes:
dependency impact is unknown, so legacy compatibility cannot waive that failure.

### Declared cross-node repair loop

The in-node loop above repairs what a node owns. A QA node whose finding belongs to
another node cannot repair itself, and it never completes, so a repair successor wired
only through `hard_blocked_by` would be unreachable. The route is the declared one:
`unattended-run-readiness-spec.json.required_repair_loops` — `{scope, qa_node_ids,
repair_node_id, closure_node_ids, max_attempts}`. `validate_unattended_readiness.py`
checks that shape before the run: every QA, repair and closure node exists, the repair
node is `hard_blocked_by` each QA node, each closure node is `hard_blocked_by` the repair
node, and a declared `max_attempts` is a positive integer. It does not check that the
declared repair can actually fix the finding. The engine loads it as `repair_loops[]`
and applies it:

- A QA node that failed **with its own current report published** satisfies the declared
  `repair_node_id`'s dependency on it — for that repair node only, for at most
  `max_attempts` attempts **of its own**. The budget is per QA node, so one repair node
  serving several QA nodes owes each of them a full budget; attempts spent on one are
  never charged to a sibling. A QA node that never ran, published nothing, or failed on an
  environment, authority, readiness or gate error has no verdict to repair against: it is
  a diagnosis case, never a repair route.
- **An attempt is spent when a repair dispatch is authorized, not when it succeeds.** The
  canonical ledger is `.allforai/bootstrap/repair-authorizations.json`, its own document,
  and both hosts reach it only through `repair_authorization.py`. The engine has no
  filesystem: every ledger operation is a prompt that runs that CLI and returns its verdict
  verbatim, which is then checked against what was asked. A verdict that names another
  dispatch, another repair node, or an answer nobody asked for is a forged receipt and
  nothing executes on it — otherwise "the ledger said so" would mean only "the agent said
  so".

  A dispatch is two durable steps, both before the executor. `authorize` charges every
  eligible obligation atomically and is **never** permission to run; `start` claims the one
  execution that charge paid for, and only the first claim is granted. Two consequences
  follow, and the Codex driver shares both. A repair whose executor errors, or that writes
  nothing, costs the same one attempt as one that delivered and did not fix the finding: a
  budget that only charged for success would bound neither, and the loop could repeat
  without end. And an interruption between the charge and the work leaves the attempt
  spent — re-granting it would hand out an attempt whose work may already be in the tree.
  A route that opens and is interrupted before any dispatch costs nothing, on either host.

  Opening the route is not the charge. The QA node's failed `transition_log` entry records
  that this QA node failed and was routed; it is the QA node's history, never the budget.
- **Only an execution the engine watched end is settled.** Settling records an outcome and
  returns no budget. An attempt whose stage threw, whose host died, or whose wave was
  quarantined by a safety halt is deliberately left unresolved: whether it ran is then a
  question for `reconcile` and evidence that can be checked, not something to guess. The
  two guesses fail in opposite unsafe directions — assume it ran and a needed repair is
  skipped; assume it did not and duplicate side effects replay on a budget already spent.
- **Consumption first; initialize only a ledger that does not exist.** The spent budget is
  read from the ledger before any node runs, never summarized out of `workflow.json` by the
  agent that loads the DAG — a count inferred by reading a file is not accounting. A ledger
  that is unreadable, belongs to another run, or carries an ambiguous history is untrusted
  state and stops the run. Only `missing_ledger` may be initialized, and the helper itself
  reads `workflow.json` and refuses to record zero for a run that already shows execution.
  Because that origin is proved, an obligation the ledger does not list really has spent
  nothing — absence is trustworthy here only because the document is.
- **An unresolved grant at startup blocks.** A charge that never reached an outcome leaves
  it unknown whether that attempt ran, so a resumed run stops for reconciliation rather
  than replaying uncertain work or refunding an attempt that may already have been spent.
- A loop that declares no `max_attempts` takes the documented default of three attempts
  per QA node. A declared `max_attempts` that is not a positive integer is unbounded, not
  a request for that default: nothing is routed, and a QA node that has already failed is
  **not re-run** — re-running it would reproduce the same failure with nothing able to fix
  it and bury the planning error in a busy run. The engine stops with that QA failure in
  `needs_diagnosis`; the Codex driver blocks the node and reports it with
  `unbounded_repair_loops`. Both validators reject the shape before the run starts; this is
  only what happens if one ever gets past them.
- No other successor may proceed on a failed dependency. A failed node is never
  `completed`, and its report is never edited to make it look passed.
- A repair opened for one node never absorbs another node's verdict in the same wave. An
  `accepted_with_gaps` result or a stopped one-shot iteration repair still ends the run
  under the recorded Run Policy, and neither node is re-run into a passing verdict.
- When the repair node **delivers**, the QA node **reruns**. Delivery, not completion, is
  the signal, and the difference is structural. A declared repair node is
  `hard_blocked_by` the QA node it repairs, and `check_artifacts.py` folds the recorded
  freshness state into `all_exist`, so while that QA node is failing the repair node's own
  evidence is stale and its independent gate withholds it by construction. Retrying inside
  the node would burn the artifact repair budget against something no repair can fix, and
  the run would end `needs_diagnosis` with `exhausted_repair_loop` on the repair node.
  So for the declared repair node of an open loop, a **withheld** gate is a delivery: the
  engine records it and moves on. An environment, authority or cross-node blocker is still
  `hard_fail` — never a delivery, never an advance — and it stops the run once the loop's
  declared budget is spent, bounded like any other dispatch that produced nothing. The
  exception is a `NON_QA_FAILURE_TYPES` verdict (`invalid_artifact_gate`,
  `invalid_readiness_gate`, `deadlock`, `safety_warning`, `needs_iteration`,
  `exhausted_retries`): structural, environmental or policy answers are not attempts that
  fell short, so they stop the run immediately, on the same reasoning that keeps them from
  opening a repair route in the first place.

  A delivery is **measured, never asserted**. The engine holds no filesystem, so its only
  independent measurement is the gate step running `check_artifacts.py --json` and
  reporting what it printed; the node's own result is never the evidence. The same step
  runs once before the node and once after, and a delivery requires all of: every declared
  exit artifact present with no status error, the gate withheld only by this loop's own QA
  node, one input-binding identity unchanged across the attempt, and at least one artifact
  whose content digest moved. Anything less — an absent measurement, a missing field, a
  touched or pre-existing artifact, a blocked report, a drifted snapshot — is
  `unmeasured_repair_delivery`, a hard failure, never a quiet advance.

  Nothing is waived. A delivery never commits, so the repair node stays out of `done`; it
  is dispatched again once the QA node passes, and must pass this same independent gate on
  its own merits before anything commits it. Every `closure_node_ids` entry stays blocked
  until the QA node itself completes — a delivered repair is not a passing QA, and the
  rerun is the only way past the loop. The Codex driver applies the same lifecycle.
- A dispatch of the repair node that itself hard-fails inside its still-open loop — an
  `unmeasured_repair_delivery`, say — is not a terminal verdict while that loop has budget
  left. Its attempt is already charged, so the next one is dispatched; when the budget is
  gone the failure stops the run with its own findings. The declared `max_attempts` is
  therefore the single bound on every repair dispatch for that QA node, whatever the
  dispatch produced. The Codex driver applies the same bound.
- When the budget is spent and the QA node still fails, that is a hard failure with the
  original findings; report it, never waive it.

After a node reports success, independently run `check_artifacts.py --node <node_id> --json`.
Non-empty `code_gaps` or `test_gaps`, partial/conditional status, placeholders, failed
validation, or other blocking findings cannot be committed as complete. Invoke the
`execution-repair-loop`, repair within its three-attempt budget, and **Rerun affected QA evidence**
through the original node plus the independent artifact gate. Exhaustion is a hard failure;
never waive, downgrade, or hide a gap.

## Phase B execution (CC: Workflow engine)

`/run` is fully autonomous after the Run Policy section — no further questions, no human stops. Drive it as:

1. Invoke the Workflow engine script at
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/run-engine/run-engine.workflow.js`.
   It reads `workflow.json` plus `unattended-run-readiness-spec.json.required_repair_loops`,
   schedules ready nodes (alignment_refs run in parallel),
   self-heals soft failures, commits each node immediately, and returns one of:
   - `{ status: "complete" }`
   - `{ status: "needs_diagnosis", hardFailures: [...] }`

2. On `complete`: run the learning-protocol extraction, then produce the Phase C report:
   a. **Evidence-anchored completeness (verification honesty).** Run
      `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/compute_completeness.py <base>` — it derives each
      node's TRUE state from its recorded `verification` evidence and writes
      `.allforai/bootstrap/completeness-report.json`. **Report the two-column result as the
      headline: VERIFIED (真验过) % vs unverified (只生成没验) %.** Never present "completed
      node count" as completeness — a node without real evidence is `unverified`, never counted.
   b. Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check_evidence.py <base>` to list any
      false "verified" claims (evidence missing / self-graded) — these are downgraded.
   c. **Launch gate:** if `completeness-report.json.critical_unverified` is non-empty, the product
      is NOT launch-ready regardless of node count — surface those critical flows as needing real
      verification. Do not call the product complete on self-attestation.
   d. Read `.allforai/bootstrap/assumed-decisions.json` + any UNRESOLVED, then stop.

3. On `needs_diagnosis`:
   a. Read `hardFailures` (always non-empty — a stuck graph carries a synthesized `deadlock`
      finding) + `workflow.json` `diagnosis_history`.
   b. GLOBAL cap (fix L1): if total entries in `diagnosis_history` ≥ 5, mark UNRESOLVED and
      stop — this catches oscillating root causes the per-cause cap misses.
   c. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/diagnosis.md`: locate the root-cause node
      (use `suspected_root_node` when present). This is autonomous — never ask the user.
   d. Per-cause cap (the policy unit-tested as engine-core `convergenceCheck`): if the same root
      cause already appears ≥2 times in `diagnosis_history`, mark it UNRESOLVED, write best-effort
      output + TODO, and stop.
   e. Otherwise apply the repair plan WITH CASCADE (fix C2):
      `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/compute_reset_closure.py .allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json <root_id...>`
      → remove the returned closure (root + transitive downstream) from the `transition_log`
      completed set, then RESUME the engine
      (same session: resumeFromRunId; cross-session: re-invoke — workflow.json idempotency
      skips already-completed nodes).

4. Repeat until `complete` or an UNRESOLVED stop.

This template is CC-only. Codex keeps its existing markdown loop (frozen).

## Recording Transitions

After each node completes or fails, append to workflow.json transition_log:

```json
{
  "node_id": "<node_id>",
  "status": "completed | failed",
  "started_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "completed_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "artifacts_created": ["<file paths>"],
  "error": "<one line, only if failed>"
}
```

## Session Resume

On first iteration if transition_log is non-empty:
1. Run check_artifacts.py to see current state
2. Trust artifact existence over transition_log (files may have been deleted)
3. Continue from where things stand

## Safety (warnings, not blockers)

- Same node fails 3 times → **before warning**, check `workflow.json.diagnosis_history` for that node:
  - If any entry has `"out_of_scope": true` → mark workflow halted, output TODO list, do NOT retry or ask user
  - If 2+ entries share the same `root_cause.node` → convergence cap reached, mark UNRESOLVED, output TODO list, halt
  - Otherwise → apply `run-policy.json.on_repeated_failure`: `continue` keeps the diagnosis
    loop going (the global and per-cause caps still stop it); `halt` marks UNRESOLVED, outputs
    the TODO list, and stops. Never ask here.
- 5 iterations with no new artifacts → output current state + TODO list
- Single node running > 10 minutes → warn but don't kill

## Termination

- All nodes' exit_artifacts are ready → success report. The report ends with
  `workflow.json.user_steps` in order (`/cross-exam`, then `/product-review`) as the steps
  the user types next; they are never dispatched, never started by a node, and never
  reported as done (ADR-0008). An empty list means the project was exempted at bootstrap.
- concept-acceptance verdict = needs_iteration → apply `run-policy.json.on_needs_iteration`:
  `halt_with_report` writes acceptance-report.md (with the fix / re-bootstrap / accept options
  listed for the human to pick afterwards) and stops; `auto_fix_once` runs one repair loop on
  the named gaps, re-runs concept-acceptance, then stops whatever the verdict; `accept` records
  `accepted_with_gaps` in assumed-decisions.json and returns a qualified outcome,
  without marking that node completed or verified; the artifact gate treats an
  `accepted_with_gaps` report status as blocking. Never ask here.
- User interrupts → transition_log is already saved, resume with /run
- Safety warning → apply `run-policy.json.on_safety_warning`: `continue` logs it and goes on,
  `halt` stops with the warning in the report. Never ask here.

## Post-Completion

**Run regardless of success or early stop:**

0. **Run log summary:**
   Run `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/summarize_run_log.py . --write-report`.
   Keep `.allforai/bootstrap/run-log.jsonl`, `.allforai/bootstrap/run-summary.json`,
   and `.allforai/bootstrap/run-summary.md` as the auditable production trace.

1. **Mark concept drift resolved (if applicable):**
   If `.allforai/product-concept/concept-drift.json` exists AND `resolved = false`
   AND all nodes completed successfully: set `"resolved": true` and write back.
   If /run stopped early or failed: leave `resolved = false` (drift still pending for next /bootstrap).

2. **Learning extraction:**
   Read `.allforai/bootstrap/protocols/learning-protocol.md`.
   Check `workflow.json.corrections_applied[]` and `diagnosis_history[]`:
   - If both empty: no learning to extract, skip.
   - For each entry in `corrections_applied[]`:
     * Extract: node, what_was_wrong (root_cause), fix_applied
     * Classify per learning-protocol.md type (mapping-gap / discovery-blind-spot / convergence / safety / other)
     * Write to `.allforai/bootstrap/learned/<category>.md` per learning-protocol.md File Naming Convention
   - For each entry in `diagnosis_history[]`:
     * Extract root_cause pattern and gaps_found domains
     * If the gap was not caught by the expected capability node → classify as "blind-spot"
     * Write to `.allforai/bootstrap/learned/blind-spots.md` (append, do not overwrite)

3. **Feedback proposal:**
   Read `.allforai/bootstrap/protocols/feedback-protocol.md`. If learning
   extraction found a universally useful meta-skill issue, run:
   `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_meta_skill_feedback.py . --category "<category>" --message "<deidentified failure pattern>"`
   This must not ask the user mid-run. Prefer a writable local `myskills`
   repository; only fall back to anonymous GitHub issue draft/auto mode when no
   local repo is available.
